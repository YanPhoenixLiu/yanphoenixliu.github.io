Principal Researcher

1. National Natural Science Foundation of China. **No. U20B2011**. *The multi-physics coupled mechanism for the material - thermal hydraulics - neutronics behaviors of CRUD layers*. Project period: 2021.01-2024.12.
   
   Role: Principal Researcher

(1) <strong>Corrosion Product Deposition</strong> - Established a non-radioactive Fe/Ni/Cr/Zn precursor system replicating in-core therma hydraulic–water chemistry conditions, and developed an ex-core accelerated corrosion product deposition technique, achieving a 98.2% characteristic parameter match between reproduced CRUD depositions and real CRUD depositions from nuclear power plants. Elucidated the mechanism of corrosion product concentration at the vapor–liquid interface and deposition on the cladding surface under subcooled boiling, and revealed the synergistic evolution of bubble growth, solute concentration, crystal growth, and particle deposition during CRUD formation, filling a key research gap in the nonlinear mechanisms of concentration, crystallization, and deposition of corrosion products.

(2) <strong>Boron Hideout</strong> - Correlated CRUD growth with boron transport behavior, and proposed a boron precipitation criterion within CRUD depositions. Developed a non-equilibrium convection–diffusion–radiolysis–reaction transport framework with an implicit material–state feedback mechanism, achieving <10% error control. Clarified the influence of operating boundaries and CRUD morphology on boron hideout, uncovered the non-equilibrium hideout mechanism and spatiotemporal distribution of boron within CRUD deposition, and identified the large-scale precipitation of boron–lithium compounds under extreme conditions.

(3) <strong>Multi-physics Coupling</strong> - Constructed neutron physics model covering micro/nanoscale boron distributions within CRUD along with porous-surface boiling heat transfer model, and developed cross-scale multiphysics simulation techniques incorporating a half–time-step coupling strategy to enhance system response resolution while maintaining high-fidelity CRUD representation and computational efficiency. Analyzed the coupled mechanisms among multiphysics parameters under corrosion product influence, clarified their pathways to reactor safety impacts, revealed the evolution of axial power shift severity with boron hideout and burnup effects, and identified the critical trigger thresholds and core spatial distribution characteristics of CRUD-induced power shift.
