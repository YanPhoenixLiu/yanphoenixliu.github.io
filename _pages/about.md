**Hi there, I am Yan (Phoenix) Liu åˆ˜å»¶ðŸ‘‹**

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a PhD Candidate in School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I obtained my BS in Nuclear Engineering in 2021 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and look forward to my PhD in Nuclear Science in 2026 also from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

<div style="height: 1.0em;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify">
I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. Xiaojing Liu, focusing on advanced nuclear reactors, exploring the thermal hydralics-netronics-material-chemistry coupling mechanism, developing high-fidelity multi-physics multi-scale coupling analysis frameworks and establishing intelligent digital design analysis strategies.

<div style="text-align: justify">
My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on Corrosion-Related Unidentified Deposits (CRUD depositions), exploring the deposition process ofcorrosion products at vapor-liquid interface, developing time-space thermodynamic kinetic model of boron hideout, and revealing cross-scale multi-physical process coupling mechanism of thermal hydraulics-neutronics-materials-chemistry.
