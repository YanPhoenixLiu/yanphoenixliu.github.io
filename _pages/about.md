**Hi there, I am Yan (Phoenix) Liu 刘延👋**

<div style="text-align: justify">
I have just finished my Ph.D. defense at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I obtained my B.S. in Nuclear Engineering in 2021 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and look forward to my Ph.D. in Nuclear Science very soon also from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My Ph.D. dissertation focuses on heat and mass transfer at the solid-liquid-gas interface via both experiment and modeling.

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. Xiaojing Liu, focusing on advanced nuclear reactors, exploring the netronics-thermal hydralics-mechanics-materials coupling mechanism, developing high-fidelity multi-physics multi-scale coupling analysis frameworks and establishing intelligent digital design analysis strategies.
