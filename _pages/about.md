**Hi there, I am Yan (Phoenix) Liu ðŸ‘‹**
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I obtained my BS in Nuclear Engineering in 2021 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and look forward to my PhD in Nuclear Science in 2026 also from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. Xiaojing Liu, focusing on advanced nuclear reactors, exploring the thermal hydralics-netronics-material-chemistry coupling mechanism of nuclear reactors, developing a high-fidelity multi-physics multi-scale coupling analysis verification method, and establishing a digital design analysis method.

**My research interests**

Materials and their fascinating application throughout energy transfer and system reliability are the prevalent theme of my research.
- CRUD Depositions and the Mitigation Strategies
- Advanced Materials for Phase-Change Heat Transfer Enhancement
- Novel Interface Characterization under Extreme Conditions
