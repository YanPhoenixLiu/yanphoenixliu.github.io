**Hi there, I am Yan (Phoenix) Liu 刘延👋**

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I obtained my B.S. in Nuclear Engineering in 2021 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and look forward to my PhD in Nuclear Science and Technology in 2026 also from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. Xiaojing Liu, focusing on advanced nuclear reactors, exploring the thermal hydralics-netronics-material-chemistry coupling mechanism, developing high-fidelity multi-physics multi-scale coupling analysis frameworks and establishing intelligent digital design analysis strategies.
